This is my Vim config. 

There's some helpful advice at http://stackoverflow.com/a/18203545/4280216

How I have this set up:

- store everything within ~\vimfiles on Windows PC
- recent versions of vim automatically look for vimrc and gvimrc within this folder -- to check, can use `:version`
- manage extensions with Vundle, which makes a `\bundle\` folder that I `.gitignore`
- keep vimwiki folder in Dropbox for syncing between computers
